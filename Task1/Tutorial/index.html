    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<u>HTML</u>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

        <p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

        <p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
        <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
        <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>

        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. 
        HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. 
        The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>


Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
            
    <!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>This is a title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
        </body>
    </html> -->
